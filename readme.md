# Palladium
A complete rewrite of my old [datasync](https://github.com/tornrpg/datasync) plugin. Development begins when the last update for the datasync plugin is pushed.

### Versioning

 - 0.10.0: Initial release

#### Info

This Plugin will support 1.13+, so make sure that the datapack (or plugin) you want to download has the correct version!
This is so I do not need to hassle with updating the plugin.

### Features

 - Download Datapacks from their link and install them into the datapacks directory
 - Support for VanillaTweaks planned, but has to be looked into
 - Maybe support for Downloading Plugins (not sure)

#### Disclaimer
I am not responsible for any damage caused by using this plugin. You decided to use it, so you're responsible.
For any issues, please open an issue in the Issues section.
