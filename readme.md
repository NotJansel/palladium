### Versioning

 - 0.10.0: Initial release
 - 0.10.1: Hotfix for 1.19.1/1.19.2 that some hover and click events are not working.
 - 0.10.2: CHange Updatechecker to use the Github API (not commited and pushed yet, too lazy)

### Info

**Development has stopped due to lack of motivation to work on this.**
Any further Update requests will be denied.

This Plugin will support 1.13+, so make sure that the datapack (or plugin) you want to download has the correct version!
This is so I do not need to hassle with updating the plugin.

This is Paper and their Forks only! I will never give support for Spigot/Bukkit as they are a major minority in Servers, especially 1.17 and upwards.
I also never had and will charge anything for my work and donating is free to your decision, if I ever give an option.
I do this in my free time so sometimes there may be inactive phases.

### Features

 - Download Datapacks and Plugins from their link and install them into the respective directory
 - Support for VanillaTweaks planned, but has to be looked into

### Contributing

This Repository is always free for contributions. To contribute, Fork the Repository, make the changes and then open a Pull Request. 
I will look over it when I have time, so do not spam me full as soon you opened a Pull Request
